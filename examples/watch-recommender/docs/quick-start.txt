WATCH-REC QUICK START GUIDE

watch-rec is an AI-powered movie and TV recommendation tool. It connects to
ChatGPT or Claude as an MCP server, tracks what you've watched, learns your
taste, and gives personalized suggestions through natural conversation.

Claude Code / Claude Desktop
-----------------------------

Add to your MCP config (~/.claude.json, claude_desktop_config.json, or
project .mcp.json):

  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "watch-rec": {
        "type": "url",
        "url": "https://scaffold-watch-rec.somotravel.workers.dev/mcp",
        "headers": {
          "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN"
        }
      }
    }
  }


ONBOARDING
==========

Start a new conversation and say:

  "Let's set up watch-rec"

The AI runs the onboarding flow, which walks you through four steps:

1. Streaming services -- which platforms you subscribe to (Netflix, Hulu,
   Max, etc.)
2. Watch history import -- upload a Netflix CSV export via the web UI, or
   skip this
3. Taste discovery -- rate 20 curated titles (1-5) so the system learns
   what you like
4. Preference questions -- answer a few follow-ups about your viewing habits

The whole process takes about 5 minutes. After onboarding, a taste profile is
generated automatically.

You can redo this anytime by saying "Refine my taste profile".


GETTING RECOMMENDATIONS
=======================

Once onboarded, just describe what you're in the mood for:

  "I want something like Severance -- smart, slow-burn, keeps you guessing"

  "Recommend a comfort comedy for tonight"

  "What should I watch with my kids this weekend?"

The AI will suggest 5-8 titles based on your taste profile, check them against
your history (so you won't see repeats), and show where each one is streaming.


MANAGING YOUR WATCHLIST
=======================

Save titles for later, browse your queue, or change priorities.

  "Add Zodiac to my watchlist"
    --> Saves it to your queue (medium priority)

  "Add The Bear to my queue, high priority, tag it 'solo night'"
    --> Saves with priority and tags

  "Show my watchlist"
    --> Lists everything sorted by priority

  "Show my high priority queue"
    --> Filters by priority

  "Remove Zodiac from my queue"
    --> Deletes it

  "Change Zodiac to low priority"
    --> Updates priority

If a title is blocked because you've already watched or dismissed it, say:

  "Add Zodiac to my queue, force it"

This clears the old state and re-adds it.


LOGGING WHAT YOU'VE WATCHED
============================

When you finish something, tell the AI:

  "I just watched The Brutalist, I'd give it a 4 out of 5"

  "Mark Nosferatu as watched"

This logs it to your history, removes it from your queue if it was there, and
improves future recommendations.


DISMISSING TITLES
=================

If you've already seen something or just aren't interested:

  "I've already seen Oppenheimer"

  "Not interested in that one"

Dismissed titles won't be recommended again.


SECOND SCREEN MODE
==================

Watching something right now? Use the second screen feature for live
companion info:

  "I'm watching Severance S2E4"

You'll get:
  - Episode synopsis (spoiler-aware for current episode only)
  - Full cast and key crew
  - Character names and actors
  - Background context, filming locations, trivia

Use single-letter shortcuts to jump to specific info:

  n   Next interesting fact
  c   Cast (actors and characters)
  w   Writers and directors
  t   Trivia
  l   Filming locations
  h   History and timeline

Examples:

  "c"   --> show the cast
  "t"   --> give me trivia
  "n"   --> tell me something interesting

You can also ask freeform questions:

  "Who plays Helly?"
  "Tell me about the director"
  "What else has that actor been in?"

This works for movies too:

  "I'm watching There Will Be Blood"


STREAMING LOOKUP
================

Check where any title is available:

  "Where can I watch Conclave?"

Returns streaming (included with subscription), rental, and purchase options
for your region.


PREFERENCES
===========

Your preferences shape recommendations. State them naturally:

  "I love slow-burn thrillers but hate slasher horror"
  "I prefer movies under 2 hours"
  "Add HBO Max and Apple TV+ to my streaming services"

View everything stored:

  "Show my preferences"


TASTE PROFILE
=============

Your taste profile is a summary of your viewing patterns, generated from your
ratings and history. View it:

  "Show my taste profile"

Regenerate it after logging more titles:

  "Regenerate my taste profile"

From here you can:
  - Upload Netflix CSV exports
  - View your watched titles and queue
  - Manage preferences and settings


TIPS
====

- Be specific about mood -- "something like early Coen brothers" works better
  than "a good movie"
- Rate titles during onboarding honestly -- even rating things you disliked
  helps the system
- Use tags on queue items -- "date night", "solo", "family" make it easy to
  filter later
- Force-add when correcting mistakes -- if something was wrongly marked as
  watched, force-add it back to your queue
- Use second screen for TV -- include the season and episode number for
  episode-specific context
